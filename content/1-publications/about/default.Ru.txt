We are independent self-publishers, dedicated to the publication of fanzines, magazines and books on street art and on various phenomena of informal urban culture. The aim of our platform is to capture ideas, memories and events not in the digital, but in the material format. *V stol* (verbatim *to write into the table*) is an idiom in the russian language, which means to make work whose results will not be in demand. Thus one creates a piece of work without an intention of publishing it.
